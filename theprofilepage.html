                What is my name? <br>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;">My full name is Konstantinos Kallias, but most people call me Kosta. Everyone (including my family) has been calling me Kosta
                for so long that it doesn't really feel to me anymore like my real name is Konstantinos.</p><br>
                What is my ethnicity/ where am I from?<br>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;">Well I am originally from Greece, but I was born in Eindhoven which is in the east of the Netherlands. I now live in the city
                called Terneuzen and there is almost nothing to do in this city.</p><br>
                How old am I?<br>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;">Although I don't look like it, I really am 17 years old. The reason most people think I am older is because of the fact that i already
                have a fairly lot amount of facial hair despite my young age.</p> <br>
                What are my hobbies?<br>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;">I enjoy watching series, movies and anime, but I have watched so many of them that I can't really find any good ones anymore
                so I will sometimes just rewatch a movie or a show. I also enjoy watching YouTube, but now that school has started again
                I can't really watch a lot anymore. I also really like to box and go to the gym to try ang get big. </p><br>
                Where do I work? <br>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;">I work at the warehouse called gamma at the moment, but I am going to leave there because it is hard for me to combine
                work and school. Upadate: I got fired so I guess that worked out quite good for me. </p> <br>
                What show or movie do I watch over and over again? <br>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;">I always rewatch the whole Hary Poter franchise every year and every year I still really enjoy watching all of the Harry 
                Potter movies. I also rewatch the movie crazy, stupid, love a lot of times because i just think that is an amazing movie.
                I also rewatch series sometimes like Prison break, grimm, That time I got reincarnated as a slime
                and this might come as a shock, but gossip girl. </p> <br>
                What languages can I speak? <br>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;">I can speak Greek, Russian, Dutch and English. Most people wonder why I speak Russian and that is a long story short
                because my mother is sort of Russian, but not by blood so I grew up with both Russian and Greek culture and that is why
                I speak both languages.</p>
