                    Welcome to my website))<br><br>
                    You probably already guessed it:), but my name is Kosta and i am a starting HBO-student. 
                    <!-- verander later naar gewoon hbo student, want dan ben ik geen beginnende hbo student meer-->
                    I chose to study at the HZ school because i liked the approach this
                    school takes to my course. The school is also not to far away 
                    from where i live, which resulted in the fact that i don't have
                    to travel for a long time to reach my destination or had to move 
                    out of the house to a place closer to the school, which makes it
                    very convenient for my parents as they weren't very fond of the
                    idea of me moving out of the house. 
                    <br><br>   
                    I think the HBO level suits me because i am very determined to 
                    get my software engineering degree, which will take me 4 years
                    to get if everything goes smoothly. I am also truly focussed on
                    self-improvement this year and i am really motivated to do that and
                    to learn a lot of new things, like programming for exapmle. <br><br>
                    Before the start of this week i had never used or even heard about html or css, 
                    but in this short amount of time i have already
                    learned how to use both of them fairly good, which i think shows again
                    how determined i am to learn new things this year. <br><br>
                    
                    The reason i think the study programme at HZ really suits my personality
                    is because i feel that you are really here for your self and that the line between 
                    indepandency and dependancy is really good. You get some explanation from te teacher for exapmle,
                    but most of the things you are going to have to learn on your own by making exercises, which i find a good way to study.
                    I also really appreciate the amount of freedom you get in comparison to high school, which makes
                    school a lot more enjoyable i find.))
