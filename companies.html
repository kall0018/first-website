              <p style="font-size: 17px;">Bethesda Game studios is a company that produces video games and is placed in the USA. I have chosen for this company because they have 
                                         created the DOOM game series, and Fallout series which i used to be a big fan of. Ofcourse they have created a lot more games but i dont really
                                        care about those. The studios are owned by Zenimax Media and the company works very agile.</p> <br>

                phrase "EA sport's it's in the game" which i think most people have heard at least once in their life. EA is a very popular video game company (as we just have established). They have produced a lot of famous games like FIFA, NBA LIVE and The Sims for example. 
               EA uses languages like C++ and C# and they work with the TOGAF Architecture development method.</p> <br>

                <p style="font-size: 17px;">Lastly I have chosen for the compeny Apple, because i am a big fan of their Iphones, Ipad and airpds and i would never
                    want an android device instead of an apple one. Apple is an American compeny started by Steve Jobs. The company develops a lot of different products like mackbooks, monitors, iphones, airpods, ipads and imac and they also have their own software, IOS. Apple programs
