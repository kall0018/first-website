              Motivation<br>
              <p style="font-size: 17px;"> According to the Oxford dictionary motivation means:<br> - A reason or reasons for acting or behaving in a particular way. (This meaning of motivation is what the assignment is about).<br>
                                        - A set of facts and arguments used in support of a proposal. <br>According to another dictionary, DICTIONARY.COM, motivation means:<br> <br> -the act or an instance of motivating, or providing with a reason to act in a certain way:                         I don't understand what her motivation was for quitting her job.
                                          -The state or condition of being motivated or having a strong reason to act or accomplish something:<br>
                                          We know that these students have strong motivation to learn. <br>
                                         - Something that motivates; inducement; incentive: <br>
                                          Clearly, the company's long-term motivation is profit. <br> <br>

                                        The concept “motivation” comes from the Latin word “movere” which means to move. The word “motivation” comes from the word “motive” meaning the reason for the things we do, reason(s) for particular actions.
                                       </p>
                
                There are various types of motivations, see some of them below: <br>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;">Extrinsic Motivation <br>
                    Extrinsic motivation does not come from within us but from outside us, for example we are told to by someone who has power or leverage over us. We do it because we are forced to do it.
                    <br>
                    Intrinsic Motivation <br> <br>
                    Intrinsic motivation comes from internal reasons in contradiction to extrinsic motivation which comes from outside us. For example when you do something to get pleasure from doing it. <br>
                    Introjected Motivation <br> <br>
                    Introjected motivation is similar to intrinsic motivation in that it also comes from within us. What makes it a different type of motivation is that if it is not done, then the person will feel the tensions of guilt. <br>
                    Identified Motivation <br> <br>
                    Identified motivation is when a person knows that something needs to be done but has not yet decided to do anything about it. <br>
                    Achievement Motivation <br> <br>
                    Achievement motivation means that a person is motivated to work hard in order to achieve the goal he has in mind. Achievement motives include the need for achievement and the fear of failure. These are the more predominant motives that direct our behaviour toward positive and negative outcomes. <br>
                    There are more motivations, but they are all kind of the same as the ones mentioned above. <br> <br>
                    Dan Pink says in his Ted Talk: <br>
                    “If you want people to perform better, you reward them, right? Bonusses, commissions, their own reality show. That’s how business work.” But after this he says that it sometimes the opposite effect occurs, as it can dull a person’s 
                    thinking and creativity. That’s why a task should involve a lot of thinking. Dan also says that we need a new approach to motivate people to work. His approach is mainly focused on intrinsic motivation. <br> <br>
                    The three main elements of this approach are: <br> 
                    -Autonomy, the urge to direct our own lives. <br>
                    -Mastery, the desire to get better and better at something that matters. <br>
                   -Purpose, the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves. <br> </p>


               Performance motivation <br>
               <p style="font-size: 17px;">
                Am I intrinsically or extrinsically motivated? <br>
               According to the motivation test I took, my motivation is for 50% extrinsically, for 20% intrinsically, 20% obviously lying apparently 
               and for 10% I’m not motivated at all which makes a lot more sense than 20% lying. <br> <br>
               I think this test was useless because there were so many more possible options to do, but you couldn’t choose those and some of which you could choose were very weird. <br>
                </p>
                Career anchors/ values <br>
                <p style="font-size: 17px;">According to the test I care most about structure, work-life balance, financial reward and working conditions.: <br> <br>
                    Structure is definitely very important to me because I have troubles doing something if it isn’t clear what I am supposed to do, when and how. 
                    Work-life balance is also very important to me because I want to be able to work properly while having time for friends, family and personal hobbies. 
                    I also care a lot about financial reward because I want to earn a lot of money so that I can buy a nice house and other stuff and have good financial stability. 
                    And last working conditions are also very important to me because I need to have my own workplace with a lot of space that is not messy or otherwise I will not be able to concentrate well and do my work good.
                    I care the least about variety and creativity because I don’t really mind working on one project for a long time for example and I don’t really care about creativity because I just don’t like to invent stuff and think of something new. 
                    Although some creativity is always going to be needed, but I don’t want to think of something entirely new or invent something entirely new unless the idea suddenly pops in my head. <br> <br>
                    
                  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>
                    Personally I don’t think I am very motivated for this study because I don’t enjoy it, but I will still learn and try to make the most of it until next year and then I want to switch to a different study. <br>
